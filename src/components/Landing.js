                Hello, my name is Elias Habash and I am a recent graduate
                from San Jose State University. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s of
                Science in Software Engineering in December of 2018 and I'm
                currently actively looking for entry-level/Jr. software
                engineering/developer roles.

                My main expertise is in web development using the MERN Stack and
                mobile development for Android. My favorite langauge to code in
